While most available software can quantify colony size, Iris adds several more phenotypes.\r\nAlso Iris can be easily expanded to new phenotypes, by writing a new readout module.\r\n\r\n### How can I download the software?\r\nThat's easy, just follow this link, it includes a binary distribution (a .jar, see below) and some example files to see how the software works:\r\nhttps://goo.gl/j0ZpIi\r\n\r\n### Using Iris\r\nIris is written in Java, which makes it compatible with most operating systems (Windows, macOS, *nix).\r\nJava software is typically distributed in JAR files (.jar ending), which you can run by a double-click (see below command-line alternatives).\r\nNext, click \"open folder\", and select a folder which holds the pictures to be processed. Iris will process any pictures with a \".jpg\" file ending, displaying any messages on the application window. \r\nYou can abort the process at any time, by closing the program.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Running Iris\r\n##### Iris GUI  \r\nTo run Iris as a window (GUI) application, open a command line window, cd into the folder the Iris JAR file is in, and run the following command:  \r\n\r\n~~~  \r\njava -Xmx1g -jar Iris_0.9.x.xx.jar  \r\n~~~\r\n\r\nNote: the Iris jar file can also be run on all systems by double clicking. To do this, first make sure you have permanently set the maximum Java heap size to 1g (1 Gigabyte). Google on how to do that in your particular system/setup.\r\n\r\n##### Iris console (e.g. for scripting)\r\nTo run Iris as a console application (no GUI window), which can be rather useful for scripting, you need to provide Iris with a profile name and a folder that pictures are found in:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\njava -Xmx1g -jar Iris_0.9.x.xx.jar \"profile name\" \"folder location‚Äù\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nValid profile names are the following:  \r\n\r\n* \"Stm growth\",  \r\n* \"Ecoli growth\",  \r\n* \"Ecoli opacity\",  \r\n* \"Ecoli opacity 384\",  \r\n* \"Ecoli growth 384 - hazy colonies\",  \r\n* \"B.subtilis Opacity (HSB)\",  \r\n* \"B.subtilis Sporulation (HSB)\",  \r\n* \"Biofilm formation\",  \r\n* \"Biofilm formation (HSB)\",  \r\n* \"Morphology profile [Candida 96-plates]\"  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n**NOTE: please keep the quotes when inputting the profile name**\r\n\r\n#### Iris output\r\nIris outputs 2 kind of files and a log file.\r\n\r\n##### .iris files\r\nThese hold the results of the feature extraction process. \r\nThey are in fact plain text tab-delimited files, which can easily be opened with any text viewer or Excel.\r\n\r\n##### .grid files\r\nthese are currently saved mainly for debugging purposes, as they demonstrate the results of gridding algorithm.\r\n\r\n##### .log files\r\nEach time Iris is run, it creates a timestamped log file. This is a text file that is currently used for debugging reasons; any error messages will also be written on this file.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nSince Iris is still under active development, I would greatly appreciate any comments regarding it's performance and/or issues you might encounter.\r\nContact: kritikos at embl dot de\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## Iris kinetics tool\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using the Iris kinetics tool\r\nThe kinetics companion tool is written in R and uses the [grofit R package](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v033i07) to calculate and plot growth curves of various readouts provided by Iris.\r\n\r\n### what can this tool do for me?\r\nThe script file `kinetics.with.iris.R` showcases a number of provided functions, including:\r\n\r\n* **reading iris files** in a given folder, and parsing information in their filenames (see file `load.all.iris.files.R`)\r\n* **plotting the spatial bias** of their values (see file `plot.in.plate.format.3.R`)\r\n* **calculating a colony's sigmoidal function fit** for a given readout, and plotting the values and Gompertz fit to be saved as pdf (see file `get.colony.growth.rates.2.R`)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### where can I get it?\r\nyou can download all scripts and example input and output files [here](https://oc.embl.de/index.php/s/NHKrarvREW7o5uw/download)\r\n",
