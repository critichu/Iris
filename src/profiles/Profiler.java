 * This class is aware of all the types of readout provided by the software.
 * So, this class provides the GUI with a list of these readout profiles.
 * When a profile has been selected by the user, this class redirects the GUI's calls to:
 * -analyze a given picture (using the selected profile's ImageSegmenter)
 * -open the settings dialog (of the selected profile)
